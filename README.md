# Computing | Algorithms | Programming

Here are some programs/procedures I learned and implemented from:

- [U.C. Berkeley C.S. 61A course taught by Brian Harvey](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E)
- [Think Python 2nd Ed. by Allen Downey](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)

This endeavour is to become a better Programmer and gain a deeper insight into computers

Programs from the book **_Think Python_** will have the prefix `tpy`
